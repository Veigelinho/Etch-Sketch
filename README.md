# Etch-Sketch
Odin Project

Hello Reader,

This is my first major project in the Odin Project Curriculum.

I appreciate you showing interest, and would really appreciate any advice
on how to improve readability, logic, or any other room for improvement.

Content/Idea:

In this Etch and Sketch, I followed https://github.com/michalosman/etch-a-sketch to guide
me through the coding.

I also added a '50 Shades'-button, to have more variables in the drawing.

As you can see in my HTML/JS files, I added many elements by script rather than by html.
This is intentional, like that I tried to improve my DOM manipulation ability, because I
think just adding elements in the HTML file is very easy, but I am here to learn!

You can hit me up on my socials: https://linktr.ee/marianveigel

Thank you in advance!

Marian Veigel
